feature.

### Nice-to-haves

> Non-essentials that might come handy

## Preparation

1. [ ] Check your doctor about vaccinations (specially if you're going to very far-away places. In Portugal this is called [Consulta do Viajante](https://www.consultadoviajante.com/))
1. [ ] Tag your suitcase/backpack. Make sure it has your name and a shippable address
1. [ ] Print your itinerary
1. [ ] Give a copy of your itinerary to someone (family, SO, friend)
1. [ ] Keep a digital copy of your passport and National ID in Google Drive, in case yours get lost
1. [ ] Keep a paper copy of your passport and national ID with you when wonder around town
1. [ ] Download maps for offline usage on Android/iPhone (Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
1. [ ] Backup your laptop (assume you are going to lose it, and remember there's client's IP in your laptop)
1. [ ] Pay your bills (or just use digital invoices and pay them online)
1. [ ] Notify your bank that you're travelling (to avoid locking your card when you buy a beer in Dublin)
1. [ ] Get someone to take care of your pets & plants
1. [ ] Don't go crazy with groceries before the journey, if you can't consume them, they might go to waste
1. [ ] Clean your house before leaving (it sucks to comeback only to find out that your fridge is now a [life ecosystem](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788514/?ref_=ttep_ep16))
1. [ ] Check roaming conditions
1. [ ] Configure your VPN on your laptop and cellphone, and make sure it works (I recommend [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) since it supports different protocols, but it might be hard to setup)
1. [ ] Check if you password manager has a [travel mode](https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/) and enable it.
